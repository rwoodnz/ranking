Sports ranking system

I am starting this primarily as a skills development project (so feedback welcome once I start generating code).
I'm a fan of competitive sports and having a simple-to-use ranking system for ad-hoc use would be handy.

### My general learning goals include:
* Agile approach
* Test Driven Development

### My technical learning goals include:
* Server-side - Node, Express
* Client-side - Knockout, CommonJS, and Browserify
* Testing - Jasmine

### My infrastructure learning goals include:

* Continuous integration - Travis

### To Do
* Set up 
* Install Jasmine, ensure working in dev environment and on Travis
* Install Knockout, ensure working 
* Investigate database options
