Sports ranking system

I am starting this primarily as a skills development project (so feedback welcome once I start generating code).
I'm a fan of competitive sports and having a simple-to-use ranking system for ad-hoc use would be handy.

### My general learning goals include:
* Agile approach
* Test Driven Development

### My technical learning goals include:
* Server-side - Node, Express, EJS
* Client-side - Knockout, CommonJS, and Browserify
* Testing - Mocha

### My infrastructure learning goals include:
* Public hosting - Heroku
* Continuous integration - Travis

### User stories
* As a user I can log in - done
* As a user I see the login on the top right
* As a user I can login through the login button on the top right
* As a new user I see the register on the top right
* As a new user I can register through a drop down from the register button

### Misc To Do
* Install Mocha, ensure working in dev environment and on Travis
* Install Knockout, ensure working

### Tidy up
